        <p>In this example, we've defined a keyframes animation called slowdown. It starts from an initial state with a scale of 1 and ends with a final state of scale 2. You can modify the animation properties as needed to achieve the desired effect.

            To slow down the animation, increase the animation-duration value. For example, setting it to 8s will make the animation take twice as long to complete as compared to setting it to 4s. Adjust the animation-timing-function property to control the easing of the animation.
            
            Remember to apply the animation to an HTML element by adding the animation-name property to the element's CSS. You can also adjust other animation properties like animation-iteration-count to determine how many times the animation should repeat.</p>
